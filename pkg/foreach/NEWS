NEWS/ChangeLog for foreach
--------------------------

1.4.5   2019-01-14
    o   Add preliminary support for evaluating %dopar% expressions in a local
        environment, when a sequential backend is used. This addresses a long-standing
        inconsistency in the behaviour of %dopar% with parallel and sequential
        backends, where the latter would evaluate the loop body in the global
        environment by default. The behaviour of %dopar% can be controlled by setting

            options(foreachDoparLocal=TRUE|FALSE)

        or equivalently via the system environment variable

            R_FOREACH_DOPAR_LOCAL=TRUE|FALSE

        with the R option taking its value from the environment variable. If both are
        set, the former overrides the latter. The current default value is FALSE,
        which retains the pre-existing behaviour. It is intended that over time this
        will be changed to TRUE.

        A side-effect of this change is that the behaviour of %do% and %dopar% will
        (eventually) be different for a sequential backend. See
        https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/foreach/issues/3 for more discussion on
        this issue.
